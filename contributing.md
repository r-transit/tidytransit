# Contributing 

The goal of this guide is to help you get up and contributing to ggplot2 as quickly as possible. The guide is divided into two main pieces:

1. Filing a bug report or feature request in an issue.
1. Suggesting a change via a pull request.

## Issues

When filing an issue, the most important thing is to include a minimal reproducible example so that we can quickly verify the problem, and then figure out how to fix it. There are three things you need to include to make your example reproducible: required packages, data, code.

## Pull requests

To contribute a change to tidytransit, you follow these steps:

1. Create a branch in git and make your changes.
1. Push branch to github and issue pull request (PR).
1. Discuss the pull request.
1. Iterate until either we accept the PR or decide that it's not
   a good fit for ggplot2.
