## Issues

When filing an issue, the most important thing is to include a minimal
reproducible example so that we can quickly verify the problem, and then
figure out how to fix it. There are three things you need to include to
make your example reproducible: required packages, data, code.

## Pull requests

To contribute a change to tidytransit, you follow these steps:

1.  Create a branch in git and make your changes.
2.  Push branch to github and issue pull request (PR).
3.  Discuss the pull request.
4.  Iterate until either we accept the PR or decide that it’s not a good
    fit.
