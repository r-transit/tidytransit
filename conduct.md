# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors to this project, we pledge to respect all people who 
contribute.

We also expect that contributors to this project will not harass one another.

Examples of harrassment include, but are not limited to,
the use of secual language or imagery, derogatory comments, racism, 
personal attacks, trolling, insults, and harassment.

Contributors are responsible for responding to such comments, commits, code, 
wiki edits, issues, and other contributions. Project contributors 
who do not follow the Code of Conduct will be removed.

Please report instances of harrassment. You can do so by contacting 
one or more of the project contributors, or by opening an issue.
